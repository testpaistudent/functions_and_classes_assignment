"""
In this program, we are going to write a class that manages a cafe that sells products such as coffee and bagels to consumers. More
specifically, we are going to track the menu of the cafe which will show the prices of each item, the stock of the cafe items which
will list the quantity of each item currently in stock, and the total amount of money made by the cafe. When customers come in and order
items, those items will be subtracted from the cafe items stock, but the total amount of money made by the cafe will increase by the
total price of what the customer ordered. You should also be able to add items to your stock to supply the demands of the customers.

The __init__ method has been filled out for you. It takes as input a menu, the items of the cafe in stock, and the total amount of
money. The menu will be a dictionary where the keys are the menu items, and the corresponding values are the price of each item. The
stock will be another dictionary where the keys are the unique items currently in stock, and the corresponding values are the number of
each item in stock. The money is a number representing the amount of money the cafe has made. By default this starts out as zero. Fill
out the other 4 methods declared in this class according to what each method is supposed to do.

        values will be the number of each item in the order. Find the cost of each item from the menu. The total cost is the sum over all
        the unique items in the order of the menu cost of each item times the number of that item in the order. If there are any items
        in the order that are not in the cafe menu, return the string 'Not for sale' instead.

    def place_order(self, order):
        """
        This function should take in an order as an input, and process that order. The order argument will be a dictionary where the keys
        will be the unique items in the order and the corresponding values will be the number of each item in the order. The function needs
        to decide if the order is valid or not. An order is valid if all the items in the order exist in the cafe menu items, and there is
        to be enough of every item in the cafe stock to meet that order. If the order is valid, then the function should do 2 things. It
        should subtract all the items that were in the order from the cafe stock taking into account the number of each item in the order,
        and the total cost of that order should be added to the money made by the cafe. Have the function then return True if the order was
        valid and False if the order was not valid. Hint: it is possible to run an instance method within another instance method. In this
        case, running self.order_cost(order) will get you the value returned in the order_cost method.
